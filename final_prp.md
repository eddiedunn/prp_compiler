# Product Requirements: Simple To-Do List Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a simple to-do list application. The application will allow users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.  The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to manage personal tasks. This application will initially focus on a single-user, local-storage solution, with future scalability in mind.


## 2. User Stories

* **As a user,** I want to be able to add new tasks to my to-do list, so that I can keep track of everything I need to do.
* **As a user,** I want to be able to edit existing tasks, so that I can update the details of my tasks as needed.
* **As a user,** I want to be able to mark tasks as complete, so that I can easily see which tasks are finished.
* **As a user,** I want to be able to delete tasks from my to-do list, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
* **As a user,** I want to be able to view all my tasks in a clear and organized manner, so that I can easily see what needs to be done.
* **As a user,** I want the application to be intuitive and easy to use, so that I can manage my tasks quickly and efficiently.
* **As a user,** I want the application to persist my to-do list data even after closing the application and reopening it, so that I don't lose my progress.
* **As a user,** I want to be able to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low), so I can focus on the most important tasks first.  (Future Enhancement)
* **As a user,** I want to be able to set due dates for tasks (e.g., date picker), so I can manage time-sensitive items efficiently. (Future Enhancement)


## 3. Technical Requirements

* **Platform:** Web application (responsive design for desktop and mobile)
* **Technology Stack:**  React (or similar JavaScript framework), local storage (initially; consideration for cloud storage in future versions).
* **Data Persistence:** Local storage using browser's capabilities.  (Future versions should explore cloud-based solutions like Firebase or Supabase.)
* **User Interface:** Clean and intuitive user interface with clear visual cues for task completion and priority (if implemented).
* **Security:** No sensitive user data will be stored initially; security considerations will be revisited for future versions with cloud storage.
* **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests will be implemented to ensure the application's functionality and reliability.
* **Deployment:**  Deployment to a publicly accessible hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

This document serves as a starting point and will be iteratively refined as the project progresses.
