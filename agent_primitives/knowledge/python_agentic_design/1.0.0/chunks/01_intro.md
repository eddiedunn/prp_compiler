# Agentic Design in Python
Agentic systems often follow a "Reason, Act" (ReAct) loop. In Python, best practices include leveraging Pydantic for data validation, Typer for CLI interfaces, and Gemini for tool-calling. Modularize actions, patterns, and knowledge as primitives, and ensure strict schema validation at every step. This approach enables robust, extensible agentic workflows.
