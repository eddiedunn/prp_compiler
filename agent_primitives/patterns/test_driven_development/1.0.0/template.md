# Test-Driven Development Pattern

1. **Write a Failing Test**
   - Describe the desired behavior with a unit or integration test.
   - Run the test suite to confirm the new test fails.

2. **Implement Minimum Code**
   - Write the simplest code that makes the test pass.
   - Keep focus on the specific requirement.

3. **Refactor**
   - Clean up the implementation while keeping tests green.
   - Apply best practices and remove duplication.

4. **Repeat**
   - Continue the cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
