  "goal": "Develop a command-line to-do list application in Python.",
  "why": "To provide users with a simple, efficient, and effective way to manage their tasks from the command line.  This addresses the need for a lightweight, easily accessible task manager without requiring a graphical user interface.",
  "what": {
    "features": [
      "Add tasks with descriptions and optional due dates.",
      "List all tasks, optionally filtered by status (e.g., completed, incomplete).",
      "Mark tasks as complete.",
      "Remove tasks.",
      "Edit existing tasks (description, due date).",
      "Save and load tasks persistently (e.g., using a text file or a simple database).",
      "Support for optional task prioritization."
    ],
    "technical_requirements": [
      "Use Python 3.7 or higher.",
      "Implement robust argument parsing (e.g., using `argparse`).",
      "Employ clear and concise command-line interface design.",
      "Ensure data persistence through a suitable mechanism (e.g., file I/O, SQLite).",
      "Handle potential errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The application successfully adds, lists, completes, removes, and edits tasks.",
      "Tasks are persistently stored and loaded correctly.",
      "The application handles invalid input and unexpected errors gracefully.",
      "The application's CLI is user-friendly and intuitive."

  "context": {
    "command_line_best_practices": "Referred to multiple online resources regarding best practices for command-line tool development in Python, emphasizing clear argument parsing, user-friendly interaction, and error handling.  Sources include: [Insert links to the 5 web search results here].",
    "to_do_list_features": "Research on common to-do list applications informed the feature set, focusing on core functionalities like adding, listing, completing, and removing tasks, along with options for due dates and prioritization.  [Sources would be added here if more specific sources were available.]"

  "implementation_blueprint": {
    "steps": [
      "Design the CLI structure and commands.",
      "Implement argument parsing using `argparse`.",
      "Develop functions for adding, listing, completing, removing, and editing tasks.",
      "Choose and implement a persistent storage mechanism (file I/O or SQLite).",
      "Write unit tests to cover core functionalities.",
      "Handle edge cases and potential errors.",
      "Implement user-friendly error messages and prompts."
