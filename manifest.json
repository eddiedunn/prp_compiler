## Purpose

Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative refinement.  This PRP outlines the requirements for adding basic TypeScript support to Claude Code.

## Core Principles

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance

## Goal

To enable Claude Code to understand, process, and generate TypeScript code, starting with basic syntax highlighting and code completion, and progressing to more advanced features such as type checking and refactoring.

## Why

- **Increased developer productivity:** TypeScript's strong typing system can improve code quality and reduce bugs, leading to faster development cycles.
- **Improved code maintainability:** TypeScript's static typing allows for better code organization and understanding, facilitating long-term project maintenance.
- **Enhanced user experience:** Providing TypeScript support enhances Claude Code's appeal to a wider range of developers.
- **Integration with existing features:**  TypeScript support should seamlessly integrate with existing Claude Code features such as code completion, refactoring, and debugging.


## What

Claude Code will gain the ability to:

- **Recognize and highlight TypeScript code:**  Correctly identify and apply syntax highlighting to TypeScript code within files.
- **Provide code completion suggestions for TypeScript:** Offer relevant code completion suggestions based on the TypeScript language specification and the context of the code being written.
- **(Future phases) Perform basic TypeScript type checking:** Identify and report type errors in the code.
- **(Future phases) Support TypeScript refactoring:** Offer refactoring options specific to TypeScript code.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] TypeScript syntax highlighting functions correctly in various file types (.ts, .tsx).
- [ ] Code completion suggestions for TypeScript are accurate and relevant in different contexts.
- [ ] Unit tests for TypeScript support pass consistently.


## All Needed Context

### Documentation & References (list all context needed to implement the feature)

```yaml
- url: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
  why: Fundamental TypeScript types and syntax.
- url: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
  why: Understanding interfaces for better type definitions.
- file: ./src/codebase/language_support/javascript.js
  why: Pattern for implementing language support modules.
- doc: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki
  section: Compiler API
  critical:  Understanding how the TypeScript compiler works is essential for implementing type checking.

```

### Current Codebase tree (run `tree` in the root of the project) to get an overview of the codebase

```bash
[Placeholder for `tree` output -  This will be a directory tree showing the project's file structure]
```

### Desired Codebase tree with files to be added and responsibility of file

```bash
[Placeholder for desired tree - This will show additions such as `src/languages/typescript.ts` etc.]
```

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```python
# CRITICAL:  The current language support architecture relies on regular expressions for syntax highlighting; this may not be sufficient for the complexity of TypeScript.  Consider using an external parser library like `typescript` or `@typescript-eslint/parser`.
# Example:  We need to ensure compatibility with different versions of Node.js.
# Example:  The code completion functionality relies on a caching mechanism; ensure that TypeScript code is cached efficiently.
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

```python
# Placeholder -  No specific data models needed initially for basic syntax highlighting and code completion.  Type checking will require data models in later phases.
```

### List of tasks to be completed to fulfill the PRP in the order they should be completed

```yaml
Task 1: Create `src/languages/typescript.ts`: Implement basic syntax highlighting for TypeScript using a robust parsing library.
Task 2: Integrate `src/languages/typescript.ts` into the existing language support module.
Task 3:  Implement code completion for TypeScript using the chosen parsing library.
Task 4: Write comprehensive unit tests for syntax highlighting and code completion.
Task 5: (Future phase) Implement basic type checking.
Task 6: (Future phase) Implement TypeScript refactoring support.

```

### Per task pseudocode as needed added to each task

```python
# Task 1 Pseudocode:
# Use a robust TypeScript parser (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/parser`) to parse TypeScript code.
# Extract syntax tokens and their types.
# Map tokens to corresponding highlighting styles.

# Task 3 Pseudocode:
# Leverage the parser to extract type information and symbols from the code.
# Use this information to generate code completion suggestions.
# Implement caching to improve performance.
```

### Integration Points

```yaml
- Integrate the new TypeScript language support module into the main Claude Code application.
- Update the documentation to include instructions on using the new TypeScript features.
- Add unit tests for TypeScript support.
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style

```bash
# Run these FIRST - fix any errors before proceeding
ruff check src/languages/typescript.ts --fix  # Auto-fix what's possible
mypy src/languages/typescript.ts              # Type checking (if applicable)
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests each new feature/file/function use existing test patterns

```python
# CREATE test_typescript.py with these test cases:
def test_typescript_highlighting():
    """Verify correct syntax highlighting for basic TypeScript constructs."""
    # ... assertions ...

def test_typescript_completion():
    """Verify accurate code completion suggestions for different TypeScript contexts."""
    # ... assertions ...

```

```bash
# Run and iterate until passing:
pytest test_typescript.py -v
```

### Level 3: Integration Test

```bash
# Launch Claude Code and test TypeScript features manually in the REPL or by processing TypeScript files.
# Record observations and ensure correct highlighting and code completion behavior.
```

### Level 4: Deployment & Creative Validation

```bash
# Placeholder - Include tests in a wider range of scenarios.
# Add manual testing with various TypeScript code examples.
# Test with different project structures and file configurations.
```

### Final validation Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] No linting errors: `ruff check src/languages/typescript.ts`
- [ ] No type errors: `mypy src/languages/typescript.ts` (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual test successful: [specific test scenarios]
- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Logs are informative but not verbose
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't hardcode values; make use of configuration options.
- ❌ Don't skip testing; thorough testing is crucial for language support features.
- ❌ Don't use inefficient parsing methods; optimize for speed and accuracy.
- ❌ Don't ignore potential edge cases or unexpected input scenarios.
